# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Ruben Ã˜degÃ¥rd, a software developer and design enthusiast.**

Love learning and experimenting with new technologies.  
I'm always chasing a problem to solve, most of which are my own.  

I'm self-hosting everything I can, including Docker containerized versions of:
- [Posthog](https://posthog.com) (Analytics)
- [GlitchTip](https://glitchtip.com) (for Sentry SDK)
- [MinIO](https://min.io) for S3 storage using the AWS SDK
- [Directus](https://directus.io/) (CMS)
- Various databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL, and [libsql](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql)).
