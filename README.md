# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Ruben Ã˜degÃ¥rd, a software developer and design enthusiast.**

Love learning and experimenting with new technologies.  
I'm always chasing a problem to solve, most of which are my own.  

I'm self-hosting everything I can, including Docker containerized versions of:
- [Posthog](https://posthog.com) (Open Source Analytics)
- [GlitchTip](https://glitchtip.com) (Opem Source alternative to Sentry with Sentry SDK)
- [MinIO](https://min.io) (Open Source S3 storage with AWS SDK)
- [Directus](https://directus.io/) (Open Source CMS)
- Various databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL, Redis, and [libsql](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql)).
